He has won the World Series, he has helped lead his team to the WBC Championship, he's a two-time all-star, he's a one-time silver slugger, he is a known speed demon with three cycles tying the all-time MLB record, but none of that matters at this moment. He is getting paid $300 million to currently be in the worst slump of his career, leaving everyone confused and asking what happened to Trey Turner. Welcome back to Star Cravings Sports, my name is Aisie Ver, as always don't forget to like, subscribe, as it shows us what you guys like to watch and helps us create more content down the line. If you were to make a list of the top 20 or so MLB players over the last five years, I wouldn't be surprised to see Trey Turner somewhere on that list, and I mean who could blame you? Over the past five years, Trey Turner has been a silver slugger, he's been on the MLB first and second team, he's won a World Series, and he's gotten contracts from the Phillies and Dodgers for millions and millions of dollars. But if you were to make a list this season of your top 20 MLB players, I wouldn't be surprised if Trey Turner didn't even crack the top 100. As the 2023 season for Trey Turner has been nothing short of a nightmare, as Trey Turner has been paid $300 million by the Philadelphia Phillies coming into this season to be one of their best players alongside players like Bryce Harper, Zach Wheeler and JT Real Mudo. But instead of that, Trey Turner has been along the likes of a triple-eye player for most of the games this season. But the craziest thing about these struggles is no one knows exactly what has happened and where they came from. As just before the season, Trey Turner took part in the WBC tournament and he was coined by some Philly fans, Captain America instead of calling him like Trout Captain America. And this makes perfect sense. In just six games, Trey Turner recorded five home runs, he scored six times, he had nine hits, eleven RBIs, bad at 391, had a 440 on base percentage, and 1.043 slugging. As well as a 1.483 OPS, and oh let's not forget, Trey Turner had a grand slam in one of the biggest moments of the entire tournament to ultimately send Team USA to the championship against Team Japan. And if your fellow Philly's fan like I am, you probably saw this and you think to yourself, wow, Trey Turner has now just joined a team that made it to the World Series. We may never lose again and go 162-0 because that's what I thought, and I was surprised after the first game of the season but we don't have to talk about that. For the most part, Trey Turner started out as advertised. He started out as a good contact hitter with elite speed. He started in the first 19 games of the season with a 444 slugging and an 819 OPS to go along with it. And if you remember those stats I just listed off about the WBC to compare those five WBC games to his first 19 games as a Philly, Trey had one home run as a Philly and just six RBIs, which would give him four less home runs and five less RBIs in 15 more games as a Philly than he did in the WBC. At first this wasn't a concern because his WBC stats are so absurd for the most part that the pedestrian stats that he had to start the season didn't throw up any red flag. But as the season got past April, Intimey and deeper into the summer, the issues that Trey Turner had had become so apparent that he started chasing pitches just as much as he started chasing answers to his problems. His powers were seemingly gone as if they were zapped and taken from him by the monsters. And this is a little director's note that I'm thinking about when I go to add clips in, I wouldn't be surprised if I just put up every single strikeout and every single bad at bat that Trey has had this year because he has been so frustrating to watch that I hope you guys watching it all that aren't fully familiar with the situation get frustrated as I am. To continue to talk about the downward slope of the season that Trey Turner has had, I will talk about the 48th game of the season which was an extremely monumental game for Trey Turner as on the 48th game of the season, he finally hit his fifth home run, tying his WBC home run total.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4287, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69ba8250-58e9-49a9-9327-b80fc2466ece": {"__data__": {"id_": "69ba8250-58e9-49a9-9327-b80fc2466ece", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "211d0d57-46a5-488a-b026-f93e809855bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "ac1634e3cdc9028bec01e219114704de199d420d3c2d49b5e7b75d19c51ce663", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "778ffd2a-02f2-4bb6-b465-ebb339602383", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "9db91fb785b00532562f71ea59d357d491acc52f1dab33dce3cd97f256186148", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e46e688-dfcc-4b84-8653-7c73756a3c7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6b665438faacb16743dcbebba176c3a59136531bc15bf8f582c18f31df45123", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f12fb8c8430342fe3eb9ca9d51f07c3f65df87f85080b5d127c9e1f998f66400", "text": "His powers were seemingly gone as if they were zapped and taken from him by the monsters.

To continue to talk about the downward slope of the season that Trey Turner has had, I will talk about the 48th game of the season which was an extremely monumental game for Trey Turner as on the 48th game of the season, he finally hit his fifth home run, tying his WBC home run total. This 48th game was also the game where he finally surpassed his RBI total from the WBC as well going from 11 to 13. And the frustrations for everybody would continue to rise whether was Trey Turner himself or the fans watching at home, everybody wanted to find an answer but the answer was seemingly never going to be found this season. People would call into Philadelphia talk shows to say I think Trey is going to turn it around this week is what they would say every single week because he had to right he's getting paid 300 million dollars to be the worst player on the team and at one point he got moved all the way down to the 8th hole and was the most expensive 8th hole in the league. The frustration finally reached a boiling point as Trey Turner who was obviously struggling majorly on the offensive side of the ball was starting to struggle immensely on defense as well as his bat started to slow even more and his defensive lows got even higher the frustration was so loud that on July 25th version of the Orioles Trey would wind up having two errors at shortstop within the first five innings and then in the bottom of the fifth inning he would argue a ball in strike call and get ejected from the game. Further proving to himself and to the city that his head is so far gone from where it should be that something has got to give and fast but the next most apparent frustration moment for Trey Turner in the field was against the marlins in a one score seven to eight game in the bottom of the 11th inning where the marlins were down to their last strike of the game and Josh Bell hits a hard ground ball up the middle towards Trey Turner he puts his glove in front of it and it shoots right past allowing the marlins to tie the game and ultimately win the game in the 12th and that moment is where things started to change. Obviously I'm the reason why we lost that game so just you know frustrated but I don't know one thing and that's just keep working so it's all I'm doing. There became a shift in the city of Philadelphia and in Trey Turner's head everyone knew we had to come together and get something done. That night Trey Turner went into the lone depot indoor batting cage and hit for the next two hours until 12 midnight to try and figure out what the hell is wrong with him. In fact Trey was in the batting cage so long after the game that Philly's manager Rob Thompson actually has been on record saying I didn't know if I should tell him to leave or not because he wants people to work on their game but at some point he might have to go home and get some rest. At this point of the season it felt like there was no coming back from this. Trey was batting 235 on the year and seemingly was never going to turn it around at this point and for Philly's fans they were arguing that they have now wasted 300 million dollars on a guy that will be here for the next 10 years. While the noise in the city and national media became louder and louder the support in the clubhouse never wavered. Every single one of the coaches, staff and teammates had full belief that Trey Turner was going to bounce back. Nick Cassianos who also signed a big deal with the Philly's last year and struggled in his first season even said that it's a mind game. You get paid all this money and you don't know what to truly do with yourself exactly. And Nick said that he believes what he went through Trey is going through as well and that give it some time he will be back. And sure Trey was expanding his zone, his bat didn't look as quick but there was not one glaring issue that came to mind when talking about what has happened to him. If it's not truly anything wrong with Trey Turner's baseball skills then what has it been? Well it sounds like it was all mental the whole time.", "start_char_idx": 3553, "end_char_idx": 8075, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e46e688-dfcc-4b84-8653-7c73756a3c7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e46e688-dfcc-4b84-8653-7c73756a3c7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "211d0d57-46a5-488a-b026-f93e809855bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "ac1634e3cdc9028bec01e219114704de199d420d3c2d49b5e7b75d19c51ce663", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69ba8250-58e9-49a9-9327-b80fc2466ece", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "f12fb8c8430342fe3eb9ca9d51f07c3f65df87f85080b5d127c9e1f998f66400", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dbec2a6-46bc-4df7-98cc-c81c5aad2728", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51aff3a6639d512381a09851a2f1cb53a31a3b9a7c6b0f73be247dfdbdbfde1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c6b665438faacb16743dcbebba176c3a59136531bc15bf8f582c18f31df45123", "text": "While the noise in the city and national media became louder and louder the support in the clubhouse never wavered.

If it's not truly anything wrong with Trey Turner's baseball skills then what has it been? Well it sounds like it was all mental the whole time. Trey has been stuck inside of his own head, he's been fighting his own demons and he's not been winning at all. In fact, Trey knows he's been bad. He would blame losses especially the one against Miami on himself. And after seeing how defeated Trey looked in most post-game pressures, the fans came together and did something unthinkable. Philadelphia Radio host and personality Jack Fritz decided to make a tweet saying hey let's give Trey Turner a standing O on Friday against the Kansas City Royals because we're stuck with him the next 10 years and we want to show him some love and try to help him get out of the slum. And how dare someone from Philadelphia say let's show this guy love instead of throwing batteries and snowballs at him. I mean how dare he do that? But Jack did it anyway and whether he thought he would gain traction or not, it gained so much traction that that Friday night, Trey Turner when he came up to the plate for the first time received a standing ovation as if he had just hit a game 7 walkoff home run. Not one person in the crowd was in their seat, everyone was standing up showing Trey Turner some love and just letting him know that hey we got your back and the love that was poured out by the city was felt almost immediately by Trey Turner. He genuinely had one of his best game in weeks, but in the post game pressur Tray said that the hit he got felt like one of his best swings all year as he was able to drive a fastball into the field for a hit rather than driving the fastball foul like he had done so so many times this year. And I say this with an extremely biased feel on the situation, the standing ovation was one of the coolest things to witness mostly because the love that Philadelphia gave Trey Turner, he then evidently gave it back saying thank you through billboards and on Instagram. And the feel good story doesn't end there, as in the 18 games since Trey Turner got a standing ovation, he is batting a 343 batting average, has an OPS over a thousand and in those 18 games he has 25 hits, five home runs and 15 RBI's almost as if Trey Turner is rushing back to be his old self. But I say that with caution because I know as soon as this video gets uploaded with my luck, Trey Turner may never hit the baseball again, but I also hope that Trey Turner continues on this path his success and hopefully we can all look back and say the standing ovation somehow changed a man's season all by just showing him some love. This love is obviously seen and felt even just looking at Trey Turner while watching a game, you can just tell he seems happier, he seems more relaxed and most importantly he seems out of his own head and is just playing the game of baseball, a game he's played since he was a kid. My opinion is I really think this is saved Trey Turner, but I don't know, what do you guys think?

If you were to make a list of the top 20 or so MLB players over the last five years, I wouldn't be surprised to see Trey Turner somewhere on that list. And I mean, who could blame you? Over the past five years, Trey Turner has been a silver slugger, he's been on the MLB first and second team, he's won a World Series, and he's gotten contracts from the Phillies and the Dodgers for millions and millions of dollars. But if you were to make a list this season of your top 20 MLB players, I wouldn't be surprised if Trey Turner didn't even crack the top 100. As the 2023 season for Trey Turner has been nothing short of a nightmare, as Trey Turner has been paid $300 million by the Philadelphia Phillies coming into this season to be one of their best players alongside players like Bryce Harper, Zach Wheeler and JT Real Mudo. But instead of that, Trey Turner has been along the likes of a triple-eye player for most of the games this season. But the craziest thing about these struggles is no one knows exactly what has happened and where they came from. As just before the season, Trey Turner took part in the WBC tournament and he was coined by some Philly fans, Captain America instead of calling Mike Trout Captain America. And this makes perfect sense. In just six games, Trey Turner recorded five home runs, he scored six times, he had nine hits, eleven RBIs, bad at 391, had a 440 on base percentage, and 1.043 slugging. As well as a 1.483 OPS, and oh let's not forget, Trey Turner had a grand slam in one of the biggest moments of the entire tournament to ultimately send us to the championship against Team Japan. And if you're a fellow Philly fan like I am, you probably saw this and you think to yourself, wow, Trey Turner has now just joined a team that made it to the World Series. We may never lose again and go 162-0 because that's what I thought. And I was surprised after the first game of the season but we don't have to talk about that. For the most part, Trey Turner started out as advertised. He started out as a good contact hitter with elite speed. He started in the first 19 games of the season with a 444 slugging and an 819 OPS to go along with it. And if you remember those stats I just listed off about the WBC to compare those five WBC games to his first 19 games as a Philly, Trey had one home run as a Philly and just six RBIs, which would give him four less home runs and five less RBIs in 15 more games as a Philly than he did in the WBC. At first this wasn't a concern because his WBC stats are so absurd for the most part that the pedestrian stats that he had to start the season didn't throw up any red flag. But as the season got past April, Intimey and deeper into the summer, the issues that Trey Turner had had become so apparent that he started chasing pitches just as much as he started chasing answers to his problems. His powers were seemingly gone as if they were zapped and taken from him by the monsters. And this is a little director's note that I'm thinking about when I go to add clips in, I wouldn't be surprised if I just put up every single strikeout and every single bad at bat that Trey has had this year because he has been so frustrating to watch that I hope you guys watching it all that aren't fully familiar with the situation get frustrated as I am. To continue to talk about the downward slope of the season that Trey Turner has had, I will talk about the 48th game of the season which was an extremely monumental game for Trey Turner as on the 48th game of the season, he finally hit his fifth home run, tying his WBC home run total.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4284, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cce2d708-5e68-4d30-a06b-aa0d0c869421": {"__data__": {"id_": "cce2d708-5e68-4d30-a06b-aa0d0c869421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c586957a-e872-4e29-ad66-4fa1505b4d0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "d1837cf19828bde178687765ef22a695c73e797aaeebf2de2501a24d1fc65009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dbec2a6-46bc-4df7-98cc-c81c5aad2728", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "51aff3a6639d512381a09851a2f1cb53a31a3b9a7c6b0f73be247dfdbdbfde1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f696d792-d9ba-4fa1-bdd5-b78367ee1930", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "87f84ae2eb031bf77682c0922edf44cfa5bfadcef77dcc20b9d0ce50d55bbba1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f34452cdd452b07808df7e3cc0f1538afed759e3e09eeab37d86fb235ee391ea", "text": "His powers were seemingly gone as if they were zapped and taken from him by the monsters.

To continue to talk about the downward slope of the season that Trey Turner has had, I will talk about the 48th game of the season which was an extremely monumental game for Trey Turner as on the 48th game of the season, he finally hit his fifth home run, tying his WBC home run total. This 48th game was also the game where he finally surpassed his RBI total from the WBC as well going from 11 to 13. And the frustrations for everybody would continue to rise whether was Trey Turner himself or the fans watching at home, everybody wanted to find an answer but the answer was seemingly never going to be found this season. People would call into Philadelphia talk shows to say I think Trey is going to turn it around this week is what they would say every single week because he had to right he's getting paid 300 million dollars to be the worst player on the team and at one point he got moved all the way down to the 8th hole and was the most expensive 8th hole in the league. The frustration finally reached a boiling point as Trey Turner who was seriously struggling majorly on the offensive side of the ball was starting to struggle immensely on defense as well as his bat started to slow even more and his defensive lows got even higher. The frustration was so loud that on July 25th versus the Orioles Trey would wind up having two errors at shortstop within the first five innings and then in the bottom of the fifth inning he would argue a ball in strike call and get ejected from the game. Further proving to himself and to the city that his head is so far gone from where it should be that something has got to give and fast but the next most apparent frustration moment for Trey Turner in the field was against the marlins in a one score seven to eight game in the bottom of the 11th inning where the marlins were down to their last strike of the game and Josh Bell hits a hard ground ball up the middle towards Trey Turner he puts his glove in front of it and it shoots right past allowing the marlins to tie the game and ultimately win the game in the 12th and that moment is where things started to change. Obviously I'm the reason why we lost that game so just you know frustrated but I want no one thing and let's just keep working so it's all I'm doing. There became a shift in the city of Philadelphia and in Trey Turner's head everyone knew we had to come together and get something done. That night Trey Turner went into the lone depot indoor batting cage and hit for the next two hours until 12 midnight to try and figure out what the hell is wrong with him. In fact Trey was in the batting cage so long after the game that Philly's manager Rob Thompson actually has been on record saying I didn't know if I should tell him to leave or not because he wants people to work on their game but at some point he might have to go home and get some rest. At this point of the season it felt like there was no coming back from this. Trey was batting 235 on the year and seemingly was never going to turn it around at this point and for Philly's fans they were arguing that they have now wasted 300 million dollars on a guide that will be here for the next 10 years. While the noise in the city and national media became louder and louder the support in the clubhouse never wavered. Every single one of the coaches, staff and teammates had full belief that Trey Turner was gonna bounce back. Nick Cassianos who also signed a big deal with the Philly's last year and struggled in his first season even said that it's a mind game. You get paid all this money and you don't know what to truly do with yourself exactly. And Nick said that he believes what he went through Trey is going through as well and that give it some time he will be back. And sure Trey was expanding his zone, his bat didn't look as quick but there was not one glaring issue that came to mind when talking about what has happened to him. If it's not truly anything wrong with Trey Turner's baseball skills then what has it been? Well it sounds like it was all mental the whole time.", "start_char_idx": 3550, "end_char_idx": 8064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f696d792-d9ba-4fa1-bdd5-b78367ee1930": {"__data__": {"id_": "f696d792-d9ba-4fa1-bdd5-b78367ee1930", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c586957a-e872-4e29-ad66-4fa1505b4d0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "d1837cf19828bde178687765ef22a695c73e797aaeebf2de2501a24d1fc65009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cce2d708-5e68-4d30-a06b-aa0d0c869421", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}, "hash": "f34452cdd452b07808df7e3cc0f1538afed759e3e09eeab37d86fb235ee391ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "87f84ae2eb031bf77682c0922edf44cfa5bfadcef77dcc20b9d0ce50d55bbba1", "text": "While the noise in the city and national media became louder and louder the support in the clubhouse never wavered.

If it's not truly anything wrong with Trey Turner's baseball skills then what has it been? Well it sounds like it was all mental the whole time. Trey has been stuck inside of his own head, he's been fighting his own demons and he's not been winning at all. In fact, Trey knows he's been bad. He would blame losses especially the one against Miami on himself. And after seeing how defeated Trey looked in most post game pressers the fans came together and did something unthinkable. Philadelphia radio host and personality Jack Fritz decided to make a tweet saying hey let's give Trey Turner a standing o on friday against the Kansas City Royals because we're stuck with him the next 10 years and we want to show him some love and try to help him get out of the slum. And how dare someone from Philadelphia say let's show this guy love instead of throwing batteries and snowballs at him. I mean how dare he do that but Jack did it anyway and whether he thought he would gain traction or not it gained so much traction that that friday night Trey Turner when he came up to the plate for the first time received a standing ovation as if he had just hit a game 7 walkoff home run. Not one person in the crowd was in their seat everyone was standing up showing Trey Turner some love and just letting him know that hey we got your back and the love that was poured out by the city was felt almost immediately by Trey Turner. He genuinely had one of his best game in weeks but in the post game presser Tray said that the hit he got felt like one of his best swings all year as he was able to drive a fastball into the field for a hit rather than driving the fastball foul like he had done so so many times this year. And I say this with an extremely biased feel on this situation the standing ovation was one of the coolest things to witness mostly because the love that philadelphia gave Trey Turner he then evidently gave it back saying thank you through billboards and on instagram and the feel good story doesn't end there as in the 18 games since Trey Turner got a standing ovation he is batting a 343 batting average has an OPS over a thousand and in those 18 games he is 25 hits five home runs and 15 rbis almost as if Trey Turner rushing back to be his old self but I say that with caution because I know as soon as this video gets uploaded with my luck Trey Turner may never hit the baseball again but I also hope that Trey Turner continues on this path his success and hopefully we can all look back and say the standing ovation somehow changed a man's season all by just showing him some love this love is obviously seen and felt even just looking at Trey Turner while watching a game you can just tell he seems happier he seems more relaxed and most importantly he seems out of his own head and it's just playing the game of baseball a game he's played since he was a kid my opinion is I really think this is saved Trey Turner but I don't know what do you guys think let me know in the comments below as always thank you for watching have a good one", "start_char_idx": 7179, "end_char_idx": 10974, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"211d0d57-46a5-488a-b026-f93e809855bc": {"node_ids": ["778ffd2a-02f2-4bb6-b465-ebb339602383", "69ba8250-58e9-49a9-9327-b80fc2466ece", "2e46e688-dfcc-4b84-8653-7c73756a3c7d"], "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp3", "file_type": "audio/mpeg", "file_size": 5285946, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}}, "c586957a-e872-4e29-ad66-4fa1505b4d0a": {"node_ids": ["8dbec2a6-46bc-4df7-98cc-c81c5aad2728", "cce2d708-5e68-4d30-a06b-aa0d0c869421", "f696d792-d9ba-4fa1-bdd5-b78367ee1930"], "metadata": {"file_path": "graph_data/Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_name": "Trea Turner Has Had a WILD 2023 Season.mp4", "file_type": "video/mp4", "file_size": 251314911, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-26", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-26"}}}}
